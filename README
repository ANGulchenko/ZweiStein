───────┨ How to play? ┠────────

The game goal is to open all cards in square of 6x6 cards. Every row of square
contains cards of one type only. For example, first row contains arabic digits
second - letters, etc. Open next cards with method of exclusion. If card does
not opened, cell contains any possible card. For example, │AB DEF│ means that
this cell may contain every latin letter except C(because card with C image is
absent. To open card use CLAIM button and to exclude card use DISMISS key.
Use tips to solve this puzzle. There are 4 types of hints:
1) Vertical hint. For example, 6⇕+. It means that 6 and + are in the same
column. 
2) Ajacent hint. Like ÷⇔4. It states that ÷ and 4 are in the ajacent columns
but it tells nothing about which letter is on the left and which is on the
right. 
3) L-R hint. 3⋯√. It says that the 3 is on the left side of another but no 
information about the distance between those cards. 
4) ₴⇔⚁⇔3. ⚁ is in the middle and others are at the ajacent columns. No info 
about about which is on the left and which is on the right, though.
